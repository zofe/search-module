* the view (of the result item, to customize item appareance)


```php
    'models' => [
        [
            'class' => \App\Models\User::class,
            'scope' => 'ssearch',
            'route' => 'auth.users.view',
            'limit' => 5,
            'view'  => 'search::item',
        ],
    ]
```


# Usage
This command will create a folder "Search" in your /app/Modules/ folder.

this component: 
`/app/Modules/Search/Livewire/SearchNavbar.php`

has the logic of "global search" in the project.
searches the users, and potentially the main models of all other installed modules.
